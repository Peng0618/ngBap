### Documentation for simulations being run
#
# Simulation 1: Ancestral relations recovery
# Draw ancestral graphs with p = 8 and measure proportion of ancestral relationships
# that can be recovered by RCD, ParcelLiNGAM, and BANG
# Sims run using: parcelLingam/orderingComparison.R
# outputs in resultsRev/orderingComp
#
# Simulation 2: Graph recovery of ancestral graphs
# Draw ancestral graphs with p = 8 and measure the proportion of times the exact graph
# or the equivalence class is recovered by RCD, FCI+, GBS, and BANG
# Sims run using: code/mag
# outputs in resultsRev/graphRec
#
# Simulation 3: Graph recovery of bow-free graphs
# Draw bow-free graphs with p = 8 and measure the proportion of times the exact graph
# or the equivalence class is recovered by RCD, FCI+, GBS, and BANG
#
#
# Simulation 4: Graph recovery with oracle
# Draw bow-free graphs with p = 10 and measure the proportion of times the exact graph
# is recovered by oracle BANG
#
# Simulation 5: Timing of graph recovery
# Draw bow-free graphs with p = 6,8,10 and measure time required of BANG vs GBS
# Sims run using: code/bang_timing.R
# outputs in resultsRev/graphRec
#
# Simulation 6:
# Draw bow-free graphs with p = 16  and measure graph recovery by BANG
# Sims run using: code/bapSims_large.R
# outputs in resultsRev/bapLarge
